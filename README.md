## Starting
```sh
npm start
```

Or start using watch for automatic reload upon code changes (convenient for developing):
```sh
npm run start:watch
```

## Before commit
```sh
npm run lint
```

If the linting gives any code-style errors it is important to fix them. Some of them might be fixed automatically by running ```npm run lint:fix```, and some might need to be dealt with manually.

Do **not** commit if lint does not pass!
